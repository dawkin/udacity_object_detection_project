# Project overview
This project is showing a variety of method to train a neural network over a given dataset. The neural network is train for object detection.
The objection detection module of a self driving vehicle is such an important module. This module help the vehicle to be aware of its surrounding. 
This way a vehicle can detect obstacle to avoid.

# Set up
To execute this training the provided workspace was used. 
All the different steps to execute this project can be found inside the file README.md

# Dataset
## Dataset analysis
This section should contain a quantitative and qualitative description of the dataset. It should include images, charts and other visualizations.
The dataset is composed by 1000 images from the waymo dataset.
## Cross validation
This section should detail the cross validation strategy and justify your approach.

# Training
## Reference experiment
This section should detail the results of the reference experiment. It should includes training metrics and a detailed explanation of the algorithm's performances.

## Improve on the reference
This section should highlight the different strategies you adopted to improve your model. It should contain relevant figures and details of your findings.
